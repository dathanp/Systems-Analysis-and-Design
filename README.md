Show casing work for an LMS called DriverPass

DriverPass is a learning management system that is designed to increase the driving test scores because there are few tools that help aid those in need. DriverPass is a system that takes the form of a website, it wants to allow students to learn from whereever they have access to internet, allow them to schedule behind the wheel practice driving, and take practice exams. The DriverPass system will allow you to access data from anywhere that has internet. 

I did well in reagards to showing how the system will operate with the use of a Use case UML. I made it clear how the different use cases interact with one another and how they access data. If I could pick one part of my project, I would revise my technical requirements. I would revise this by giving clear instructions as to what type of hardware is needed to run this system, instead of giving generalied ideas of what they should get. 

I interpreted the users needs by seperating the users functional and non-functional requirments and building the system based off what the system needs to function properly and then adding the non-functional requirements. Asking the question of what would the user want their system to do in the future will give you a better image of the direction their system is headed. It's important to consider the users needs because they will have a different perspective than a system designer and will see certain aspects of their product as more important rather than what the system designer thinks is important. A great model to follow when trying to understand the user is called the User Journey, this will let you know how this user reacts when they are faced with a problem and how they solve it. 

Some technique that I would use in the future to analyze a system and design it is a bottom up design. This lets me find what I need to build the most viable product and the build on top of this system.
